# Warehouse Robot Pathfinding using Q-Learning

This project simulates the training of warehouse robots to efficiently navigate through a warehouse environment to perform picking operations. Picking involves gathering individual items from various locations in the warehouse to fulfill customer orders.

## Overview

In this project, we use Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to train the robots. The robots learn the shortest path between the item packaging area (goal) and all other locations within the warehouse where the robots are allowed to travel.

## Features

- Define the warehouse environment including its states, actions, rewards, and aisle locations.
- Implement Q-learning algorithm to train the robots.
- Find the shortest path between any location within the warehouse and the item packaging area.
- Visualize and analyze the learned paths.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Run the Python script
